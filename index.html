        <h2>Class A Amplifier</h2>
          <p>
            This project was a small introductory project done at the Virginia Tech
            Amp Lab. This was to introduce me to PCB design and the schmatics. The amp
            was created by Nelson Pass and this amplifier was a single stage and single
            ended amplifier.
