        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p class="indent">
          I am from Virginia, and I am an only child. My interests are in keyboards, audio gear, and learning.
          My current keyboard is a Sangeo60 HHKB with alpaca switches and BoW GMK keycaps, as well as a eggplant artisan keycap
          from GEONWORKS as my esc key. I love listening to other peoples' audio setup, I do love mine very much as well, but
          I find joy in finding that others have the same interest listening to music with a great setup. My audio setup is not
          that great yet but one day. Current I am using KEF q150s powered by aiyima a07. Then for my headphones and iems, I have
          them connected to SMSL MK II DAC that is then connect to a JDS ATOM preamp. The headphones are Sundaras and a Koss KPH30i.
          The iem have is the Moondrop blessing dusk. There are even more interest such a pc building, working out, cooking, reading
          both manga and other genres of books, and learning about languages, cars, photography, and drawing. Please reach out if you,
          have similar interests would be great to discuss, as there still much I don't know about in each topic.
